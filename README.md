Hey All, This was a team project during the summer. Do enjoy our Analysis!


EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This data driven policy brief analyses police violence in the US from 2013-2021, considers resulting implications and provides precise recommendations about which policies need to be implemented to decrease police violence. The data analysis revealed that police violence is most predominant in California, Texas, and Florida, with individuals aged between 30-50 being targeted the most. Besides, the data demonstrated that police violence follows racial profiling as Hispanics, Whites and Blacks are most often affected. Resulting implications are therefore social injustice, loss of trust in public institutions, psychological and physical harm, and a threat to public safety. 

Governments are urged to implement four major recommendations, namely an anti-discrimination policy prohibiting racial profiling and violence; a policy on implicit bias training helping law enforcement to recognize, understand and mitigate their implicit bias; a policy on community collaboration fostering personal relationships and trust in law enforcement; and a policy on transparency, demanding police
officers to wear body cameras. 


Introduction

In May 2020, public policy on police violence gained traction not only in the US but also on a global scale. This was when George Floyd – 46-year-old black US citizen – was brutally killed by police officers during a police intervention in Minneapolis (Hill et al., 2020).
The murder of Mr. Floyd triggered protests around the globe and since then, police violence related issues became even more recurrent topics in the news and public discussions. Is police violence targeting a specific demographic, and where in the US does it occur most frequently?

How can governments intervene and change public policy so that police violence decreases?


This policy brief reviews a police violence database in the US from 2013 - 2021 and brings insights related to location, gender, age, race, and geography of over 9000 police violence cases. First, a research overview will be provided, showcasing the history of police
violence and current public policies. Next, the data will be analyzed by employing sophisticated data visualization methods, empowering readers to comprehend and engage with the findings effectively. Lastly, implications and recommendations will be provided, contributing to informed decision-making and the pursuit of evidence-based policy interventions.


Research Overview

Police violence refers to the unjustified and excessive use of force by law enforcement, which can result in severe physical and psychological harm and even fatalities. It encompasses actions that are unreasonable and go beyond what is necessary in each situation. Unfortunately, police violence is often characterized by discriminatory practices that unfairly target individuals based on their race, ethnicity, gender, or religion.

Police Violence Then and Now

Throughout history, police violence has been a contentious issue. In the 1830s and 1840s, authorities focused on maintaining civil order, monitoring freed slaves, and appeasing the interests of elites (National Black Lawyers, 2021). While the public supported controls on
the use of force, it often served the political desires of those in power. Instances of police violence, particularly against black Americans, have been prevalent throughout history. Martin Luther King, Jr. highlighted this issue in the 1960s, and advancements in technology and social media have made it more visible (National Black Lawyers, 2021).

Examples of police violence include the Chicago Police Department's killings in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the racial profiling and resistance to civilian oversight by the Detroit Police Department during the civil rights movement, and the unlawful actions of the STRESS operation in Detroit in 1973 (National Black Lawyers, 2021). The most significant recent case is the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020, which ignited global protests and calls for police reform (National Black Lawyers, 2021). These historical and contemporary instances demonstrate the ongoing problem of police violence in America and an urgent need
to address these issues.

Research Approach

In this study, a dataset on police violence was thoroughly examined and sourced from Kaggle. The dataset spanned from 2013 to 2021. Before conducting the analysis, the data was cleaned, which included the elimination of blanks as well as removing data points that included above 10% unknown variables. A meticulous analysis was then conducted to identify patterns, trends, and factors associated with police violence incidents throughout the period in the US.

Research Results

The results of the research demonstrate clear patterns and trends when analysing cases of police violence across different states. Some states had a higher concentration of reported incidents such as California, Texas, and Florida, which made them significant hotspots
compared to others. These findings shed light on the differences in regional police violence. Moreover, the study examined how these incidents affected different demographics, revealing interesting and uncommon trends, such as age group 30-50 years old as well as Hispanics and Whites being the races victimized the most by police violence.

Overall, the research findings offered a comprehensive understanding of police violence incidents across states. The identification of prominent regions and the exploration of demographic dynamics surrounding these incidents provide important information for discussions and initiatives on public policies aimed at addressing and mitigating police violence.

Current Polices on Police Violence and Misconduct

The Fourth Amendment protects against unwarranted searches and seizures. Evidence obtained through illegal searches can be excluded from a case with the help of a criminal defence attorney (Arndt, 2021). 

The Department of Justice (DOJ) prevents police misconduct by forbidding officers from violating citizens' constitutional rights. They can investigate and request policy changes if a pattern of incidents is detected (Arndt, 2021). 

The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the OJP Program Statute make it illegal for police officers to discriminate based on factors like colour, sex, race, religion, or national origin. Victims of such misconduct can file lawsuits under these laws (Arndt, 2021). 

Laws like the ADA and Rehabilitation Act protect people with disabilities from discrimination. They can seek compensation through the DOJ and file lawsuits if they experience discrimination (Arndt, 2021).
